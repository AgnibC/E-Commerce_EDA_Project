# ðŸ›’ E-commerce Sales EDA Project

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a global e-commerce business selling a variety of products across different countries.

The goal was to derive meaningful business insights from messy, raw sales data using the Medallion Architecture approach, refining it into a structured, analysis-ready dataset.
